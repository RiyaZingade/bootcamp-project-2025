          JavaScript has long been the backbone of web development, powering everything from small interactive components to complex web applications. 
          However, as projects grow larger, managing JavaScriptâ€™s flexible, dynamically typed nature can become difficult. 
          This is where TypeScript comes in. 
          Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing and other powerful 
          features to help developers write more predictable and maintainable code.
        </p>

        <p>
          At its core, TypeScript adds types to JavaScript. In plain JavaScript, variables can hold any type of value, 
          and their type can change during runtime â€” which sometimes leads to unexpected errors. TypeScript, on the other 
          hand, allows you to define the type of each variable, function parameter, and return value. For example, you can 
          explicitly declare that a variable should only contain a string:
        </p>

        <p>
          If you later try to assign a number to username, TypeScript will flag an error during compilation â€” 
          before your code even runs. This early error detection is one of the biggest advantages of using TypeScript.
          Another important concept is type inference. TypeScript is smart enough to infer the type of a variable from its initial value. 
          For instance, if you write let age = 25;, TypeScript automatically understands that age is a number. This means you donâ€™t always need to explicitly 
          declare types, making your code both safe and concise.
          TypeScript also introduces interfaces and type aliases, which help define the structure of objects and ensure that they follow specific patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, the User interface ensures that any object passed into the greet function must have both name and age properties 
          of the correct types. This feature greatly improves collaboration on large projects, where multiple developers need to 
          work with consistent data shapes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond basic types, TypeScript supports union types, enums, tuples, and generics, giving you more control and 
          flexibility when defining complex data structures. It also integrates seamlessly with modern development tools 
          and frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js, providing intelligent autocomplete, real-time error checking, 
          and rich editor support.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under the hood, TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or JavaScript 
          environment. This means you get all the benefits of strong typing without sacrificing compatibility. The process 
          is managed through a configuration file called tsconfig.json, which lets you customize how TypeScript compiles 
          your project â€” for example, specifying which version of JavaScript to output or enabling strict type checking.
        </p>

        <p>
          In essence, TypeScript bridges the gap between JavaScriptâ€™s flexibility and the robustness of statically 
          typed languages. By learning its basic features â€” types, interfaces, and inference â€” you can write cleaner, 
          more reliable code thatâ€™s easier to maintain and debug. Whether youâ€™re building a small personal project or a 
          large-scale application, understanding TypeScriptâ€™s basics is a powerful step toward becoming a more confident 
          and efficient developer.
